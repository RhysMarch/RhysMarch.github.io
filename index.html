                    A simulation of the Boids algorithm which demonstrates the flocking behavior of birds.
                    This project utilizes Three.js and dat.GUI for the 3D visualisations and interactive controls.
                    You can change the number of boids, their speed, disable specific behaviours, etc.

                    A second-year university team project between me and 4 others.
                    Meal Mate is a web application aimed at reducing food waste and achieving the sustainability goal of zero hunger.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I stepped up as the team leader, ensuring we stayed organised and in sync throughout the project.
                    My responsibilities included task delegation, initialising our project repository with the base code,
                    and configuring Docker for everyone for local database testing. I also took on the review of code contributions to maintain quality
                    and I created a complex Gantt Chart to map the planning of our project.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Meal Mate contains many features, some of which I developed and or helped with.
